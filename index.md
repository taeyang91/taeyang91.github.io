Hello, my name is Taeyang Lee. I am a passionate software developer who loves turning ideas into code. I am also a proud dad of one son and currently living in Calgary. ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦

I was born and raised in Busan, South Korea [(Check out this beautiful city!)](https://www.visitbusan.net/en/index.do){:target="_blank"} and moved to Toronto to pursue my passion for programming. I earned a Computer Science degree at the University of Toronto in 2019.

My journey into software development began when my cousin taught me how to print out the classic "hello world!" message with Python on my computer screen. It was like magic! Since then, I was fascinated with programming and determined to turn my interest into a professional career.

Over the past years, I have developed a wide range of skills and experiences through diverse projects by solving real-world problems, and I learned a lot along the way. My love for programming is still growing stronger every day!
